- 👋 Hi, I’m Mert Ozalasar
- 👀 At the moment I’m more interested in backend web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning express.js and git/github and many other things...
- 💞️ I’m currently working on my web app -- [a food satisfaction survey](https://github.com/Egm1803/happy-food-survey).
- 🍳 I'm also a professional chef :baby_bottle: and an expectant father.
